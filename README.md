# CryptoRaggie-Website-Recreation
Intro

The challenge was to recreate the navigation side bar on this website:https://cryptoraggies.io/index.html

To line uo the items to the left I initally used the a tag to create links. Then I changed the display value to block but that didmt do anything. I looked at the website's code and found that they used unordered lists. So i used the ul tag and all the items stacked.

Next step was to shift the items down so I increased the line height of the list itmes and increased height of the ul

Problems
1. could not close gap between top of purple bar and top of page
2. Alignment of list items is not equal to the list items on the original page
3. Need a content delivery library to use the proper icons. Will dowload at a later time
4. Could not find font-style nor font-size using "inspect" on the original website
